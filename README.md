# CS50 Web Capstone Project

## Overview

This is a Notes App built with Django, React, and CSS that allows users to efficiently create, edit, and delete notes. The app uses Django as the backend to provide APIs and React on the frontend for dynamic interactivity. The database is implemented with SQLite, with its structure defined using Django models. Users can organize their notes into folders, add tags, and filter notes by both tags and folders. The app also supports archiving and restoring notes, providing a simple way to manage active and archived content. Designed with a fully responsive interface, the app works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, offering an intuitive and user-friendly experience for note management.
